## June 4th, 2024 update
- Added version 2.1F number to the logo.
- Pokémon assetbundles have been re-inserted so overall mod size is smaller, and the bundles are cleaner. Changes include:
	- A vanilla issue with Arceus forms with their ambient textures has been fixed
	- Clone Pikachu now has a full set of custom animations
	- All PLA/Hisuian 'mons now have a custom rare battle idle animation
	- Minor fixes to custom mons, such as smoothing Spiky-Eared Pikachu's spiky ear model 
- Various UI fixes for too low/invisible 'mons on box or Pokédex screens for Sky Battlen't 'mons.
- The Pokédex Habitat Screen has been adjusted for all 'mons (including statics, gifts, honey trees) and is now accurate to the in-game data for 2.1 Final. (Forms do not have separate habitat screens; all data for one species is displayed on one screen.)
- Gigaton Hammer no longer crashes when used in a Contest.
- Great Marsh cameras no longer dip into the Void.
- All Box Sprites for 'mons are now cleaner, higher quality, show if the 'mon is shiny or gender variant, and should no longer cause lag in battle.
  - Eggs should now show before they are hatched if they are shiny or not, including the Manaphy Egg.
- Eggs can now be released when in the boxes.
- Player variation sprites such as the weight compare body sprites and the map player heads have been replaced by a single symbolic image each. This is to adjust for player costume variations and custom outfits in the future.
- Hall of Fame images for all newly inserted Pokémon or regional forms should now be corrected and show the accurate regional form or custom 'mon.
- Custom battle trainers have been newly inserted or adjusted such as Darach and Caitlin, Steven, and Dahlia. They should no longer stutter in their animations.
- Fixed minor script issues such as the Bike Shop Owner in Eterna City.
- Underground minigame diggable items have been adjusted, no more Spheres and Arceus Plates, but more evo stones and other useful items have been added.
- An issue with some Trainer battles having incorrect EV setups on some 'mons has been fixed.
- Skill Swap TM NPC dialogue has fixed.
- Power Items added to the Veilstone Department Store 2F.
- Spear Pillar floor tile collision adjusted to remove invisible walls.
- Reset Guru should now properly reset Dialga, Palkia, Heatran and Groudon.
- All Underground sphere shops removed for good as their shop data had been removed previously, but the guys remained with broken shops.
- Restored moves now have slightly more fitting move animations based on existing BDSP move animations, instead of Pound placeholders both in Battle and Contests.
	- Twineedle in particular has had its entire custom sequence fully restored as a proof of concept.
- Some non-functional moves have been stripped from Pokémon learnsets, since they couldn't be restored in 2.1F.
	- These are: Miracle Eye, Odor Sleuth, Foresight, Snatch and Me First.
- Fixed various bugs with Pokémon Species Data.
- Slowbro's form will now hatch the correct Slowpoke forms; fish 'mons now all have egg group Water 2 instead of Water 3; various vanilla forms of 'mons missed getting rebalance data applied to them (Burmy, Wormadam, Shellos, Gastrodon, Castform etc); removed invalid wild held items from certain 'mons.
- Pokémon Footprints on the Pokédex have been removed to prevent issues when adding new Pokémon and accessing related data (such as Footprint Guy on Route 213).
- Dialogue files have all been edited so that other languages have every proper placeholder setup in the files, ready to be translated by others. All vanilla language data has been inserted, so the only things that need translation are anything custom or new from our mod.
