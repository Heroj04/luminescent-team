                This site documents all Pokémon available in Luminescent Platinum 2.0F, including their locations, types, abilities, stats, evolutions with methods, forms, 
                wild held items, and movesets. Feel free to take a look at the <a href={useBaseUrl("/mapper")}>Mapper</a> if you are looking for pokemon on a specific route.
                <br/><br/>
                Mobile users will need to swap from portrait to landscape mode if they wish to see full move descriptions in the appropriate drop downs.

                <ul>
                  <li>Clicking on an Ability will list its effects on the same page.</li>
                  <li>
                    Clicking on item rates will also show you what they change to when a Pokémon with Frisk, Super Luck or Compound Eyes are at the front of the party.
                  </li>
                  <li>A comparison toggle to view vanilla BDSP stats against any changes we have made.</li>
                  <li>The Search bar now scrolls with the page instead of staying at the top of the page.</li>
                </ul>
