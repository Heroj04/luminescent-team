PlaceData in BDSP are object in the game that are placed down throughout the world. This can be anything from NPCs to hidden items to static legendary encounters and more.

## JSON Structure

Here is an example from `Placedata_A01`, which is a woman in T01 - Twinleaf Town, the starter town.

```

## Attributes

### ID

The unique identifier of the PlaceData. This can be referenced in Scripting for animation commands.

The ID should follow this naming scheme.

```
{zone_name}_{placedata_name}
```

### zoneID

The ID of the [Zone](../dictionary/zones.md) the PlaceData should be spawned in. This is an number.

### TrainerID

If you want your PlaceData object to be a "line of sight" trainer, you must provide it with a Trainer ID, which is a reference to which party you want it to have.

### ObjectGraphicIndex

This is what determines what your Placedata will look like.

| Index | Description |
| - | - |
| 1-121 | NPCs |
| 501-505 | Hidden machine blockers |
| Assetbundle Number* | Pok√©mon |

\* This might just be DexID/00/00, the zeroes referring to formID, gender, shiny status and so forth. Example: 1510000 would be Mew.

### ColorIndex

The color variation that is used by the placedata. -1 matches the player's (used for mom).

### Position

The X/Y position that your object will be placed at in the zone that you determined.

:::info
For overworld maps, 0,0 is in the top left of the whole map.
:::

### HeightLayer

The height position that your object will be placed at.

This can be lower than ground level, so if your object is not appearing/is underground, I suggest increasing this number.

:::info
Setting this number higher than ground level this should always set the object on the ground.

Might not work with some interactions.
:::

### HeightIgnore

This will allow you to interact with the object irrelevant of the height difference, if set to 1.

This is commonly used in-game when interacting with rock climb objects.

### Size

Determines the X/Y size of the object, 1 = 1 tile.

### Rotation

Determines which directional rotation your correct will stand at. 0-360.

### MoveLimit

Certain [MoveCodes](#movecode) allow your object to "wander", this will restrict it to X/Y from the starting position.

### EventType

This usually determines if something is a trainer, must be 1 if so. Otherwise, leave it at 0.

### MoveCode

Determines how your object will stand/act. Up/down/left/right/moving/sitting down are all determined by this.

| Code | Description | MoveParam0 | MoveParam1 | MoveParam2 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 0 | | | | |
| 1 | Static | | | |
| 2 | Look around | | | |
| 3 | Move around | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |
| 7 | | | | |
| 8 | | | | |
| 9 | | | | |
| 10 | | | | |
| 12 | | | | |
| 13 | | | | |
| 14 | | | | |
| 15 | | | | |
| 16 | | | | |
| 17 | | | | |
| 20 | | | | |
| 36 | | | | |
| 40 | | | | |
| 42 | | | | |
| 45 | | | | |
| 53 | | | | |
| 54 | | | | |

### MoveParam0 MoveParam1 MoveParam2

Certain [MoveCodes](#movecode) require this, more research required, but when using TrainerIDs, you must have a [MoveCode](#movecode) of 14-17 and a MoveParam0 of how many tiles you want the trainer's line of sight to be.

### TalkLabel

This is the function name that will be called when you interact with the object and is how you get scripts called upon interaction.

### ContactLabel

Pretty sure this is stubbed. Never managed to get it working.

### Work

This is a flag and is what determines if the object is visible/invisible.

With a flag of 4000 it will always be visible.

For example, if your object has a Work of 2816 and that flag is "set" during a script with [_FLAG_SET](commands/gamedata/041-flag-set.md), the next time you enter that zone, the object will no longer be there.

### Dowsing

Accepts values of 0-2, 1-2 if the item is intended as a hidden item, it's what determines how far away your itemfinder will pick it up.

### LoadFirst

Gives a priority to the loading of objects that may exist on the same tile, or require priority loading.

### DoNotLoad

Stubbed?

### TalkToRange

Determines how far away you can be in order to interact with the object.

### TalkToSize

Determines how far away you can be in order to interact with the object.

### Talkbit

Determines which direction you can talk to an object from, best practice is to leave this at 15.
